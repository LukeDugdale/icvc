## Say hello to ICVC {{ date: '2023-10-10T00:00Z' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> Introduction 


Welcome to the Internet Computer Venture Capital (ICVC), a new pathway for supporting and accelerating projects on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Imagine a platform where you, as a token holder, get to be a part of the decision-making process, guiding and fostering the next generation of innovative ventures on the ICP. 

The ICVC, governed by the Service Nervous System (SNS), aims to democratize investment opportunities, allowing us to collectively back promising projects and aid them in navigating the path from conception to realization. Let's explore how we can collaboratively drive innovation and opportunity in the ICP ecosystem, making decentralized funding accessible, transparent, and community-driven.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC: A Lifeline for ICP Startups in a Challenging Investment Landscape


In a bearish crypto market, further stressed by significant regulatory pressure from the SEC against major players like Binance and Coinbase, ICP startups are navigating a challenging investment environment. The squeeze on ICP startups is exacerbated by a significant liquidity problem, impeding their ability to raise funds through crowdsourcing. While projects such as SNS and Funded.app offer web-3 crowdfunding alternative, their effectiveness is limited by the overall shortage of liquidity in the ecosystem, constraining available ICP for investment in Dapps. 

This is where ICVC steps in - a community-oriented investment vehicle designed to navigate these challenges. By pooling resources, ICVC aims to infuse essential capital into ICP startups, enabling them to not just survive, but to innovate and prosper.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC: Navigating Collective Investment


ICVC is a collective investment conduit where your participation directly shapes our financial adventures within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Our primary focus rests on three digital domains, each offering a diverse array of investment opportunities:
- SNS Launches 
- Funded Campaigns & NFT Releases 
- Any other spot opportunities

### <SparkleIcon /> How does it work - A brief intro to ICVC mechanics


ICVC works by using funds from two origins: the SNS treasury as well as the ICVC foundation, to launch multiple funds on an annual basis (Fund 1, Fund 2, Fund 3, etc.). These funds will be launched with a pre-set amount of ICP from the treasury, as well as a pre set amount of ICP from the ICVC foundation. The launch of a fund is, ofcourse, subject to an SNS vote. 

When a Fund is launched, ICP is deployed from the treasury, as well as from the ICVC foundation to the fund. Each fund is run by a multi-sig wallet, that is open source and operated by the SNS ICVC protocol. Changes to how these multi-sig wallets operate can be made via an SNS vote. 

After a Fund is launched, with a certain amount of ICP and a set of Fund administrators, each investment decision will also be up for SNS vote. This is where the tech behind ICVC comes in. 

As each fund is a multi-sig wallet, it requires not only community votes to enact investment decisions, but also a group of administrators to sign all transactions from that multi-sig wallet, assuring community participation and safe transactions. Funds will be able to vote in administrators, who will become administrators of the multi-sig wallet. Administrators will also have to be approved by the foundation, who equally have the power to remove administrators if they are interfering with community voting, or preventing transactions from passing despite community votes. 

This multisig wallet will require two things to make an investment decision. First, it will require an SNS vote to enact an investment decision, and it will then require numerous signatures from all of the funds administrators, as well as investment committee members to approve any given transaction.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC Investment Mechanism: An Overview of Fund Operations


Embracing a structured and sustainable approach towards investment, the ICVC DAO will operate through a series of distinct funds, each designed with a specific strategy and financial pool. This meticulous segmentation ensures varied and strategic investment, safeguarding ICVC from being tethered to a single market trend or investment paradigm.

- Annual Fund Initiation: A new fund (e.g., Fund 1, Fund 2, Fund 3, etc.) will be introduced annually, enabling ICVC to explore fresh investment avenues and adapt to the evolving market landscape. 
- Fund Constitution: Each fund is formulated using a predefined financial model: 10% of the treasury liquidity plus 10% of the annual rewards accruing from the foundation's staked tokens. This ensures a stable and consistent financial baseline for each fund while maintaining a balance in the treasury for overarching stability and other opportunities.
- Individualized Investment Strategies: Although united under the ICVC banner, every fund will harbor its own investment strategy, catered to its specific financial constitution, market trends, and the collective wisdom of ICVC’s community. 
- Independently Operated Pools: Every fund operates its financial pool independently. This independent operation ensures that the performance or challenges faced by one fund do not directly impact the others, safeguarding ICVC’s overall financial health and maintaining diverse investment portfolios.

### <SparkleIcon /> Fund Governance and Investment Decision Process

Navigating through ICVC's investment pathway involves a structured, transparent, and collective approach, empowering every voter to actively participate in crucial decision-making processes:

- Proposal and Initial Vote: Any holder with voting power can submit an investment proposal, which simultaneously goes up for an initial community vote. The community collectively decides, right at this stage, whether to advance the proposal to a detailed investigation phase without any pre-vetting.
- Investment Committee Selection: A favorable initial vote triggers the selection of an Investment Committee, tasked with undertaking an in-depth analysis of the proposed investment. 
- Investigative Analysis: The committee, through meticulous research and evaluation, presents its findings to the community, ensuring all details and potential risks are transparently communicated. 
- Final Voting Round: Armed with the committee's findings, the community partakes in a final voting round to determine whether to proceed with the investment. 
- Secure Fund Release: If the community consents to the investment, funds are securely transferred to the recipient. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Selection and Operation of the Investment Committee

ICVC places immense value on a transparent and accountable investment process. Thus, the Investment Committee, constituted of DAO administrators, operates under the following framework:

- Becoming a DAO Administrator: Individuals desiring to become DAO administrators must submit an application and successfully pass a community vote within the DAO. Crucial to maintaining transparency and legal compliance, all potential administrators must undergo KYC process before approval.
- Formation of the Investment Committee: Once an investment proposal passes the initial vote, a committee is formed from the pool of approved DAO administrators, tasked with thorough scrutiny of the proposed investment.
- Administrator Compensation: Rewards for administrators are sourced from the investment fund and depend on the proposed investment's value. The size of the Investment Committee, usually between 3 to 6 administrators, and their compensation are scaled according to the financial scope of the investment.
- Value-Driven Decisions: With a structured process and motivated, vetted professionals in the Investment Committee, every analysis, and subsequent decision, is guided by informed, transparent, and value-oriented deliberation.

This methodology ensures that the ICVC not only makes wise, community-backed investments but also that the individuals dedicating their expertise to the Investment Committee are fairly remunerated, maintaining a sustainable and proficient investment environment.

### <SparkleIcon /> Investment Exits and Profit Distribution

ICVC navigates investment exits with clear, community-driven protocols to ensure equitable and transparent management of outcomes.

- Exit Proposal: Any member with voting power can initiate an exit proposal for an investment, which instantly triggers a community voting process. 
- Technical Evaluation: Depending on the exit’s complexity, an Investment Committee may be assembled to navigate technicalities of the exit, although this isn't always necessary.

### <SparkleIcon /> Specific Exit Mechanisms for Individual Funds:

Every fund within ICVC will employ a distinct exit mechanism, determined via community vote during the fund constitution. For Fund I, the ICVC team has established a specialized exit approach, mitigating the risk of market dumps and fostering stable investment management.

- Investment Committee Authority: The Investment Committee, once approved by the community, will maintain full autonomy over exit decisions for Fund I, enabling timely sale decisions without necessitating additional community votes.
- Majority Rule within Committee: Exit decisions will be guided by a majority vote within the Investment Committee, ensuring decisions are balanced and reflect the collective insight of committee members.
- Maintaining Decentralization: To prevent decision-making consolidation and uphold transparency, each investment within a fund will be managed by a different Investment Committee, safeguarding against overarching control and preserving decentralization in exit strategies.

### <SparkleIcon /> Fund Disbursement Post-Exit:
- Breakeven/Same Price Exit: If the exit price equals the original investment, the initial investment value is automatically channeled back into the treasury. 
- Loss: Should the investment be sold at a loss, the total amount received is routed into the treasury. 
- Profit: If an exit yields a profit, the profit portion is placed into the respective fund's profit pool.

### <SparkleIcon /> Profit Pool Management:
- Annual Dividend Vote: At each year's end, a vote is conducted amongst all DAO participants to decide upon the distribution of dividends, sourced exclusively from the profit pool. 
- Dividend Percentage: The specific percentage of the profit pool designated for dividend distribution to ICVC token holders is determined through community voting. 
- Remainder Allocation: Any undistributed profit is automatically allocated back into the treasury, ensuring the continued viability and growth of the ICVC.

### <SparkleIcon /> Onboarding External Capital

ICVC is a community-driven entity, but it acknowledges the potential and opportunities that external capital injections can bring to amplify its impact and reach.

- Investment Propositions: ICVC may consider financial support from external investors, but only through a strict voting process. All proposals for outside funding must be approved by a community vote.
- Token Integrity: To preserve the integrity of ICVC tokens and shield against inflation, external investors will not purchase ICVC tokens directly, nor will new tokens be minted for this purpose.
- New Fund Creation: If the community vote approves the external investment, a new fund will be established. This fund will embody co-injection principles; the external investor and the treasury will collaboratively inject capital. For instance, if the capital split is 40-60%, the same ratio will be applied to dictate voting power and profit sharing within that fund.

### <SparkleIcon /> Ensuring a Fully Decentralized and Rugpull-Proof System

ICVC prioritizes a transparent, secure, and fully decentralized framework, designed to protect against potential vulnerabilities and safeguard against rugpulls.

- Utilizing Robust Voting Infrastructure: We use the Network Nervous System (NNS) infrastructure, developed and audited by Dfinity, ensuring a secure and resilient foundation for our voting system and safeguarding against possible manipulations.
- Incorporating Multi-Sig Wallets in Fund Management: Each Fund within ICVC functions as a multi-sig wallet* to enhance decentralized control over investments. After a community-backed investment decision is made, fund disbursement mandates digital signatures from several DAO administrators. This multi-signature approach ensures secure and decentralized transaction execution, protecting against centralized risks while maintaining transactional integrity.

(* Multi-Sig Wallet: A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet requires multiple approvals, or digital signatures, from a defined group of people (e.g., DAO administrators) to authorize a transaction.)

### <SparkleIcon /> Template investment report and exit report

To help the DAO operate efficiently, and consider all the necessary intangibles involved in an invesmtent decision - there are templates required by the DAO for an investment committee report, which is a pre-requesite for a final DAO investment vote, as well as for an exit report. 

A typical investment report template will looke like this:

It will be the job of the investment committee to tailor this template for each investment decision. 

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC Tokenomics Overview at launch

Upon launch via a Service Nervous System (SNS), ICVC's token distribution is strategically structured as follows:

- ICVC Foundation: 40% (Locked for 8 years)
- Treasury: 40%
- Founding Team: 10%
- SNS Participation (Public): 10% 

### <SparkleIcon /> Token Locking: Key to Participation and Reward

In the ICVC structure, token locking is the gateway to becoming an active participant in all investment and organizational decisions. Here’s what it entails:

- Total Voting Access: Locking your tokens gives you voting power, it’s therefore a requirement for participation. Only locked tokens enable holders to weigh in on all ICVC decisions, from investment choices to organizational changes.
- Earn a 10% Annual Return: For the commitment to locking tokens, holders are rewarded with a 10% return, minted annually by ICVC, enhancing the financial benefits of active, long-term participation.

### <SparkleIcon /> The ICVC Foundation: A Pillar of Stability and Oversight

Rooted in stability and future-proof governance, the ICVC Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the longevity, compliance, and ethical operation of ICVC.

- Token Holding: The foundation holds 40% of all ICVC tokens, providing a stabilizing presence in the market. 
- Locked Tokens: These tokens are locked for 8 years, affirming a long-term commitment and insulating the foundation and ICVC from short-term market fluctuations. 
- No Voting Power: Despite its substantial token holdings, the foundation does not possess voting rights, thereby preventing centralization and ensuring decision-making remains in the hands of the community of locked token holders.
- Token Management: Depending on the fund's performance, the foundation either burns tokens or distributes token rewards (10%, annually) to a new fund, consistently aligning with ICVC’s growth and sustainability strategies. 
- Administrative and Legal Oversight: The foundation handles all administrative and legal tasks, ensuring ICVC's adherence to regulatory compliance and managing day-to-day operational logistics. 
- Moderation of Investment Committees: While detailed insights will follow in subsequent sections, the foundation plays an integral role in moderating investment committees, safeguarding the ethical and strategic allocation of investments.


### <SparkleIcon /> Dividends

As each Fund progresses, the DAO can vote to send profits from Funds back to the treasury - but not only. It can also vote to distribute profits to token holders. 

In this way, participating in the ICVC token allows you to benefit from ICVC's success. 

The funds collected by the token on public markets can be used by the foundation (who collects 10% on their 40% locked tokens) to sell and deliver ICP to new Funds. This means that buying the token is a way of delivering funds to investments. 

As such, it is only right that the DAO maintains dividend opportunities to reward token holders for the success of ICVC.
