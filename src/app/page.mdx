## Say hello to ICVC {{ date: '2023-10-10T00:00Z' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> Introduction 

Welcome to the Internet Computer Venture Capital (ICVC), a new pathway for supporting and accelerating projects on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). 

Imagine a platform where you, as a token holder, get to be a part of the decision-making process, guiding and fostering the next generation of innovative ventures on the ICP.

The ICVC, governed by the Service Nervous System (SNS), aims to democratize investment opportunities, allowing us to collectively back promising projects and aid them in navigating the path from conception to realization. 

Let's explore how we can collaboratively drive innovation and opportunity in the ICP ecosystem, making decentralized funding accessible, transparent, and community-driven.


### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC: Navigating Collective Investment


ICVC is a collective investment conduit where your participation directly shapes our financial adventures within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). 

Although we expect to launch many funds, our primary and immediate focus will rest on three digital domains, each offering a diverse array of investment opportunities:

- SNS Launches
- DEX liquidity provisioning
- Early stage Ventures


### <SparkleIcon /> How does it work - ICVC mechanics

ICVC works by using funds from two origins: the SNS treasury as well as partnerships with the ICVC foundation, to launch multiple funds (Fund 1, Fund 2, Fund 3, etc.). These partnerships could be with LPs, or private investment groups to manage funds with the ICVC framework. 

Each fund will be launched with a pre-set amount of ICP from the treasury set aside as a budget for that fund. 

When a Fund is launched, ICP is unlocked and deployed to the ICVC treasury, serving as a budget for a management team. Management teams will have to be approved at the time of the SNS launch for a new fund, and the profiles of members in each management team will vary. We will aim to  range from experts in investment financing and venture capital  to ICVC holders themselves, who will have to approve all investment decisions put forward by management teams. 

Management teams will not receive the funds for investment directly. The funds will simply be accessible in the DAO treasury, for deployment to individual investments subject to SNS DAO vote. Each individual investment in a Fund will be approved or denied following a thorough proposal and investment review submitted by the management team. 

### Management fees

To align the management team with the DAOs interests, every fund will pay management fees to the dedicated team. Typically in VCs, management fees are set as a percentage of the total fund amount annually. 

The management fee will typically be two percent of the value of the fund per year.This aligns with the general fee structure for regular VCs. However, every fund and management fee structure will have to be approved by SNS vote. 

### Different Funds

Once a fund is launched, with a management team and a mangement fee structure, the team can get on with the task at hand, which will vary fund on fund. 

ICVC will start with three initial funds in it’s first year after an SNS:

### <SparkleIcon />Fund 1 - Early Venture Fund for ICP Projects

Fund 1 will have for aim to find high potential early ventures in the ICP ecosystem, and provide them with Pre Seed funding pre product market fit and pre SNS. 
It will be run by a management team experienced in venture capital processes, where a selection process will be designed to identify projects with potential , and carry them through the investment process. 

The investment process will be subject to vote by SNS. In the case of Fund 1, the proposal to initiate an investment process will be drafted for the community. 

For Fund 1, this process will include interviews with project creatores, team meetings discussing the potential and risks involved in a particular projects, an analysis on their tech stack, team and revenue streams will be presented to the community also. 

Following a thorough investigation, an investment report and proposal will be put forward for SNS vote.. 

This report, as well as containing arguments in favor of the investment, will expose the risks involved, the potential challenges of the project and more. 
It will also expose exit strategies. This will likely function as a spread limit price on any of the IC Dexs. Exit strategies may be changed subject to SNS vote. 


### <SparkleIcon />Fund 2 - Liquidity Provisioning for DEXs

The aim of Fund 2 will be to provide liquidity to various DEXs on ICP to generate revenue from both liquidity pools and active market making.

In this case of Fund 2, there will be open source codebases describing the mechanics and mathematics of investment decisions. These algorithms will be made public and will be coded on smart contract canisters hosted on the internet computer. These smart contract canisters will be owned and governed by the ICVC SNS Dao.

As such, Fund 2 will have a different kind of management team, adapted to the expertise required to develop these various investments 

Fund 2 will generate codebases for the efficient management of: 

1 - Providing liquidity for AMMs

2 - Actively managing a market maker portfolio on ICP based order book exchanges (such as Helix, ICDex). 

3 - Generating revenue from arbitrage opportunities (particularly related to ck tokens). 


### <SparkleIcon /> Fund 3 - SNS Launches

The premise of Fund 3 is simple, ICVC will have a fund dedicated to providing ICP to SNS Token launches. 

Every new SNS will be investigated the ICVC Fund 3 management team, who will provide a public and thorough report on the nature of the project, the team behind the project, it’s ambitions, strengths and challenges. 

If a vote for investment is approved bu the DAO following management’s review, then tokens will be allocated from the ICVC treasury to the SNS swap at the time of launch, 

Exist strategies for these tokens will also be pre=approved, with public limit orders placed on a spread across various DEXs, subject to change by SNS vote. 

### Future Funds

ICVC will not be limited to it's initial 3 funds, The potential for the initiation of new funds will make ICVC ever evolving to the opportunities and needs of the ICP ecosystem. 

A few ideas for potentoal future funds include: 

- an ICVC Index Fund 
- a Carbon and Sustainability Fund
- Growth Stage Series A Fund

### <SparkleIcon /> Investment Exits and Profit Distribution

ICVC navigates investment exits with clear, community-driven protocols to ensure equitable and transparent management of outcomes.

- Exit Proposal: Any member with voting power can initiate an exit proposal for an investment, which itiggers a management review and community driven vote. 
- Technical Evaluation: Depending on the exit’s complexity, some exit strategies may be continous and pre programmed. This could include smart contracts buying and selling tokens at different prices on a DEX, for example. In this case, all code will have to be approved by SNS DAO, with full audit documentation. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Fund Disbursement Post-Exit:
- Breakeven/Same Price Exit: If the exit price equals the original investment, the initial investment value is automatically channeled back into the treasury. 
- Loss: Should the investment be sold at a loss, the total amount received is routed into the treasury. 
- Profit: If an exit yields a profit, the profit portion is placed into the respective fund's profit pool.

### <SparkleIcon /> Profit Pool Management:
- Annual Dividend Vote: At each year's end, a vote is conducted amongst all DAO participants to decide upon the distribution of dividends, sourced exclusively from the profit pool. 
- Dividend Percentage: The specific percentage of the profit pool designated for dividend distribution to ICVC token holders is determined through community voting. 
- Remainder Allocation: Any undistributed profit is automatically allocated back into the treasury, ensuring the continued viability and growth of the ICVC.

### <SparkleIcon /> Onboarding External Capital

ICVC is a community-driven entity, but it acknowledges the potential and opportunities that external capital injections can bring to amplify its impact and reach.

- Investment Propositions: ICVC may consider financial support from external investors, but only through a strict voting process. All proposals for outside funding must be approved by a community vote.
- Token Integrity: To preserve the integrity of ICVC tokens and shield against inflation, external investors will not purchase ICVC tokens directly, nor will new tokens be minted for this purpose.
- New Fund Creation: If the community vote approves the external investment, a new fund will be established. This fund will embody co-injection principles; the external investor and the treasury will collaboratively inject capital. For instance, if the capital split is 40-60%, the same ratio will be applied to dictate voting power and profit sharing within that fund.

### <SparkleIcon /> Ensuring a Fully Decentralized and Rugpull-Proof System

ICVC prioritizes a transparent, secure, and fully decentralized framework, designed to protect against potential vulnerabilities and safeguard against rugpulls.

- Utilizing Robust Voting Infrastructure: We use the Network Nervous System (NNS) infrastructure, developed and audited by Dfinity, ensuring a secure and resilient foundation for our voting system and safeguarding against possible manipulations.
- Incorporating Multi-Sig Wallets in Fund Management: Each Fund within ICVC functions as a multi-sig wallet* to enhance decentralized control over investments. After a community-backed investment decision is made, fund disbursement mandates digital signatures from several DAO administrators. This multi-signature approach ensures secure and decentralized transaction execution, protecting against centralized risks while maintaining transactional integrity.

(* Multi-Sig Wallet: A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet requires multiple approvals, or digital signatures, from a defined group of people (e.g., DAO administrators) to authorize a transaction.)

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC Tokenomics Overview at launch

Upon launch via a Service Nervous System (SNS), ICVC's token distribution is strategically structured as follows:

- ICVC Foundation: 40% (Locked for 8 years)
- Treasury: 40%
- Founding Team: 10%
- SNS Participation (Public): 10% 

### <SparkleIcon /> Token Locking: Key to Participation and Reward

In the ICVC structure, token locking is the gateway to becoming an active participant in all investment and organizational decisions. Here’s what it entails:

- Total Voting Access: Locking your tokens gives you voting power, it’s therefore a requirement for participation. Only locked tokens enable holders to weigh in on all ICVC decisions, from investment choices to organizational changes.

### <SparkleIcon /> The ICVC Foundation: A Pillar of Stability and Oversight

Rooted in stability and future-proof governance, the ICVC Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the longevity, compliance, and ethical operation of ICVC.

- Token Holding: The foundation holds 40% of all ICVC tokens, providing a stabilizing presence in the market. 
- Locked Tokens: These tokens are locked for 8 years, affirming a long-term commitment and insulating the foundation and ICVC from short-term market fluctuations. 
- Token Management: Depending on the fund's performance, the foundation either burns tokens or distributes token rewards (10%, annually) to a new fund, consistently aligning with ICVC’s growth and sustainability strategies. 
- Administrative and Legal Oversight: The foundation handles all administrative and legal tasks, ensuring ICVC's adherence to regulatory compliance and managing day-to-day operational logistics. 
- Moderation of Investment Committees: While detailed insights will follow in subsequent sections, the foundation plays an integral role in moderating investment committees, safeguarding the ethical and strategic allocation of investments.


### <SparkleIcon /> Dividends

As each Fund progresses, the DAO can vote to send profits from Funds back to the treasury - but not only. It can also vote to distribute profits to token holders. 

In this way, participating in the ICVC token allows you to benefit from ICVC's success. 

The funds collected by the token on public markets can be used by the foundation (who collects 10% on their 40% locked tokens) to sell and deliver ICP to new Funds. This means that buying the token is a way of delivering funds to investments. 

As such, it is only right that the DAO maintains dividend opportunities to reward token holders for the success of ICVC. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Roadmap

Our roadmap is broken down into three phases: 

Phase 1: Setting up ICVC

ICVC will require the set up of a foundation in switzerland, as well as a founding team that will lay the foundation for the ICVC framework, investment mechanisms, voting mechanisms and more. This will require some initial funding from grants and/or deed investors. 

Phase 2: Launching the SNS and our first three funds

Following a successful SNS, ICVC will be able to set off the first three funds in year 1, with the funds collected from the SNS Swap Sale. 

Phase 3: Launch of Future Funds

If ICVC is successful, it will be able to launch many new future funds from money retrived by profit pools into the DAO treasury. Each fund will have its own direction, ambition and management team. 

The creation of a new fund will be subject to SNS vote.
