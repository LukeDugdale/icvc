## Say hello to ICVC {{ date: '2023-10-10T00:00Z' }}

### <SparkleIcon /> Introduction 


Welcome to the Internet Computer Venture Capital (ICVC), a new pathway for supporting and accelerating projects on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Imagine a platform where you, as a token holder, get to be a part of the decision-making process, guiding and fostering the next generation of innovative ventures on the ICP. 

The ICVC, governed by the Service Nervous System (SNS), aims to democratize investment opportunities, allowing us to collectively back promising projects and aid them in navigating the path from conception to realization. Let's explore how we can collaboratively drive innovation and opportunity in the ICP ecosystem, making decentralized funding accessible, transparent, and community-driven.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC: A Lifeline for ICP Startups in a Challenging Investment Landscape


In a bearish crypto market, further stressed by significant regulatory pressure from the SEC against major players like Binance and Coinbase, the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has seen its token price plunge by a notable 95% since its launch. This is not just a number, but a signal of the substantial pressure on investors and, crucially, on entrepreneurs and Dapp being built on the ICP. 

Startups utilizing ICP are navigating a challenging investment environment. No venture capitalists are actively investing in ICP startups, creating a vital deficit amid the already challenging financial climate. Moreover, Polychain's dedicated beacon fund, which previously supported ICP startups, has shifted its focus away from the ICP ecosystem.The squeeze on ICP startups is exacerbated by a significant liquidity problem, impeding their ability to raise funds through crowdsourcing. While Funde.app offers a web-3 crowdfunding alternative, its effectiveness is limited by the overall shortage of liquidity in the ecosystem, constraining available ICP for investment in Dapps. 

This is where ICVC steps in - a community-oriented investment vehicle designed to navigate these challenges. By pooling resources, ICVC aims to infuse essential capital into ICP startups, enabling them to not just survive, but to innovate and prosper.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC: Navigating Collective Investment


ICVC is a collective investment conduit where your participation directly shapes our financial adventures within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Our primary focus rests on three digital domains: SNS launches, Funded Campaigns, and NFT releases, each offering a diverse array of investment opportunities:
- SNS Launches 
- Funded Campaigns & NFT Releases 
- Any other spot opportunities

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC Tokenomics Overview at launch

Upon launch via a Service Nervous System (SNS), ICVC's token distribution is strategically structured as follows:

- ICVC Foundation: 40% (Locked for 8 years)
- Treasury: 40%
- Founding Team: 10%
- SNS Participation (Public): 10% 

### <SparkleIcon /> Token Locking: Key to Participation and Reward

In the ICVC structure, token locking is the gateway to becoming an active participant in all investment and organizational decisions. Here’s what it entails:

- Total Voting Access: Locking your tokens gives you voting power, it’s therefore a requirement for participation. Only locked tokens enable holders to weigh in on all ICVC decisions, from investment choices to organizational changes.
- Earn a 10% Annual Return: For the commitment to locking tokens, holders are rewarded with a 10% return, minted annually by ICVC, enhancing the financial benefits of active, long-term participation.

### <SparkleIcon /> The ICVC Foundation: A Pillar of Stability and Oversight

Rooted in stability and future-proof governance, the ICVC Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the longevity, compliance, and ethical operation of ICVC.

- Token Holding: The foundation holds 40% of all ICVC tokens, providing a stabilizing presence in the market. 
- Locked Tokens: These tokens are locked for 8 years, affirming a long-term commitment and insulating the foundation and ICVC from short-term market fluctuations. 
- No Voting Power: Despite its substantial token holdings, the foundation does not possess voting rights, thereby preventing centralization and ensuring decision-making remains in the hands of the community of locked token holders.
- Token Management: Depending on the fund's performance, the foundation either burns tokens or distributes token rewards (10%, annually) to a new fund, consistently aligning with ICVC’s growth and sustainability strategies. 
- Administrative and Legal Oversight: The foundation handles all administrative and legal tasks, ensuring ICVC's adherence to regulatory compliance and managing day-to-day operational logistics. 
- Moderation of Investment Committees: While detailed insights will follow in subsequent sections, the foundation plays an integral role in moderating investment committees, safeguarding the ethical and strategic allocation of investments.

### <SparkleIcon /> ICVC Investment Mechanism: An Overview of Funds Operation

Embracing a structured and sustainable approach towards investment, the ICVC DAO will operate through a series of distinct funds, each designed with a specific strategy and financial pool. This meticulous segmentation ensures varied and strategic investment, safeguarding ICVC from being tethered to a single market trend or investment paradigm.

- Annual Fund Initiation: A new fund (e.g., Fund 1, Fund 2, Fund 3, etc.) will be introduced annually, enabling ICVC to explore fresh investment avenues and adapt to the evolving market landscape. 
- Fund Constitution: Each fund is formulated using a predefined financial model: 10% of the treasury liquidity plus 10% of the annual rewards accruing from the foundation's staked tokens. This ensures a stable and consistent financial baseline for each fund while maintaining a balance in the treasury for overarching stability and other opportunities.
- Individualized Investment Strategies: Although united under the ICVC banner, every fund will harbor its own investment strategy, catered to its specific financial constitution, market trends, and the collective wisdom of ICVC’s community. 
- Independently Operated Pools: Every fund operates its financial pool independently. This independent operation ensures that the performance or challenges faced by one fund do not directly impact the others, safeguarding ICVC’s overall financial health and maintaining diverse investment portfolios.

### <SparkleIcon /> Fund Governance and Investment Decision Process

Navigating through ICVC's investment pathway involves a structured, transparent, and collective approach, empowering every voter to actively participate in crucial decision-making processes:

- Proposal and Initial Vote: Any holder with voting power can submit an investment proposal, which simultaneously goes up for an initial community vote. The community collectively decides, right at this stage, whether to advance the proposal to a detailed investigation phase without any pre-vetting.
- Investment Committee Selection: A favorable initial vote triggers the selection of an Investment Committee, tasked with undertaking an in-depth analysis of the proposed investment. 
- Investigative Analysis: The committee, through meticulous research and evaluation, presents its findings to the community, ensuring all details and potential risks are transparently communicated. 
- Final Voting Round: Armed with the committee's findings, the community partakes in a final voting round to determine whether to proceed with the investment. 
- Secure Fund Release: If the community consents to the investment, funds are securely transferred to the recipient. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Selection and Operation of the Investment Committee

ICVC places immense value on a transparent and accountable investment process. Thus, the Investment Committee, constituted of DAO administrators, operates under the following framework:

- Becoming a DAO Administrator: Individuals desiring to become DAO administrators must submit an application and successfully pass a community vote within the DAO. Crucial to maintaining transparency and legal compliance, all potential administrators must undergo KYC process before approval.
- Formation of the Investment Committee: Once an investment proposal passes the initial vote, a committee is formed from the pool of approved DAO administrators, tasked with thorough scrutiny of the proposed investment.
- Administrator Compensation: Rewards for administrators are sourced from the investment fund and depend on the proposed investment's value. The size of the Investment Committee, usually between 3 to 6 administrators, and their compensation are scaled according to the financial scope of the investment.
- Value-Driven Decisions: With a structured process and motivated, vetted professionals in the Investment Committee, every analysis, and subsequent decision, is guided by informed, transparent, and value-oriented deliberation.

This methodology ensures that the ICVC not only makes wise, community-backed investments but also that the individuals dedicating their expertise to the Investment Committee are fairly remunerated, maintaining a sustainable and proficient investment environment.

### <SparkleIcon /> Investment Exits and Profit Distribution

ICVC navigates investment exits with clear, community-driven protocols to ensure equitable and transparent management of outcomes.

- Exit Proposal: Any member with voting power can initiate an exit proposal for an investment, which instantly triggers a community voting process. 
- Technical Evaluation: Depending on the exit’s complexity, an Investment Committee may be assembled to navigate technicalities of the exit, although this isn't always necessary.

### <SparkleIcon /> Specific Exit Mechanisms for Individual Funds:

Every fund within ICVC will employ a distinct exit mechanism, determined via community vote during the fund constitution. For Fund I, the ICVC team has established a specialized exit approach, mitigating the risk of market dumps and fostering stable investment management.

- Investment Committee Authority: The Investment Committee, once approved by the community, will maintain full autonomy over exit decisions for Fund I, enabling timely sale decisions without necessitating additional community votes.
- Majority Rule within Committee: Exit decisions will be guided by a majority vote within the Investment Committee, ensuring decisions are balanced and reflect the collective insight of committee members.
- Maintaining Decentralization: To prevent decision-making consolidation and uphold transparency, each investment within a fund will be managed by a different Investment Committee, safeguarding against overarching control and preserving decentralization in exit strategies.

### <SparkleIcon /> Fund Disbursement Post-Exit:
- Breakeven/Same Price Exit: If the exit price equals the original investment, the initial investment value is automatically channeled back into the treasury. 
- Loss: Should the investment be sold at a loss, the total amount received is routed into the treasury. 
- Profit: If an exit yields a profit, the profit portion is placed into the respective fund's profit pool.
